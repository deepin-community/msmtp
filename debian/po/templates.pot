" Starting from version 1.8.22, msmtp will no longer be SetGID. Hence the\n"
" creation of the system-wide configuration (/etc/msmtprc) using debconf is\n"
" removed.\n"
" .\n"
" From one side, using the system wide configuration implied msmtp to be "
"SetGID\n"
" but recent security hardening changes in GLib prevent SetGID binaries "
"built\n"
" against libsecret to talk to the D-Bus session, and therefore prevent it "
"from\n"
" being able to retrieve passwords from gnome-keyring or KWallet.\n"
" .\n"
" On another side, it was easy for a local user to obtain the credentials\n"
" stored in /etc/msmtprc even if the file was not readable for this user "
"when\n"
" msmtp was SetGid.\n"
